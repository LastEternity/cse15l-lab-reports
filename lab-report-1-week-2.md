<h1 style="font-size:30px;">Week 2 Lab Report</h1>

This will be a tutorial for incoming 15L students about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. Included will be short descriptions and screenshots of:
1. Installing VScode
2. Remotely Connecting
3. Trying Some Commands
4. Moving Files with scp
5. Setting an SSH Key
6. Optimizing Remote Running

<br> 

First, Install VSCode. The link can be found <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>. Download the correct version for your PC. Once done, it should look like the second image depicted underneath. <br>

<br>
<br>

Now that Visual Studio Code is installed, you will need to remote connect to the UCSD server. In order to do this, first install OpenSSH (if on Windows), <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse">here</a>. Following that, please find your login credentials, from UCSD <a href="https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php">here</a>. Once you have the account information, open Visual Studio Code and type <code>ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu</code> (cs15lwi22zz will be replaced by your course-specific login) from the terminal. You'll likely be asked a question in the terminal; just answer yes. Following this, type your account-specific password in order to connect, as displayed in the images below. Now, you are connected to your ieng6.

Now that you are remotely connected, you can try some commands. I personally tried the <code>cat</code> command which can print out a file's contents, for example. Depending on the commands which are tried, different results may occur and/or some may not work (on your local machine, for example). Displayed are some examples:

Now that you have tried out several commands, it is time to test the scp command, which moves files from the client to the server. In order to use this, the <code>scp [file_name] cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/</code> command must be run on the local computer's terminal. Once done, you will be prompted for the password; submit it and the scp command should have copied the file over to the server.
