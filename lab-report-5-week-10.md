This week we experimented with the tests provided by the commonmark-spec. For this lab report, we ran tests on my code and Joe's and looked for differing answers. Shown underneath, the differences in results can be seen below; we got the differences in the results of the test by running the diff command with: <code>diff markdown-parse-2/results.txt Week9MyMarkdownParse/markdown-parse/results.txt

As can be seen, our implementations differed when reading the 194th markdown test, shown here: 
 

Here is the output of Joe's at line 212:

  As the expected output is <code>[]</code>, my code worked while Joe's did not.
