<h3 style="font-size:25px;">Summary</h3>
This week we experimented with the tests provided by the commonmark-spec. For this lab report, we ran tests on my code and Joe's and looked for differing answers. Shown underneath, the differences in results can be seen below; we got the differences in the results of the test by running the diff command with: <code>diff markdown-parse-2/results.txt Week9MyMarkdownParse/markdown-parse/results.txt
